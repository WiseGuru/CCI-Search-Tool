# CCI Search Tool
This is a Python script to search and return CCIs from a local XML file.

You can download the full list of CCI's from the [DoD Cyber Exchange](https://public.cyber.mil/stigs/cci/)

If you want to get started as soon as possible, just download the zip from the exchange above, extract it, and save the `cci_search.py` into the extracted folder.

Run the script from your terminal of choice and enter the control ID you're looking for (e.g., 'AC-1' or 'AC-1 (2)').
The search results will get saved as a file in the subfolder "txt_output" and open in your default text editor.
